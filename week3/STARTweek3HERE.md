![Website](https://github.com/Drewbie345/okcoders-spring2016/blob/master/week2/HTML-CSS-Project/eterna.jpg)

Your mission is to recreate this static site using your knowledge of HTML and CSS (and your ability to Google what you don't know!). Use Twitter Bootstrap to speed up the process. 

Focus on recreating the layout (if you need to use different icons/colors/etc. that's fine). I've included images in PROJECT folder in WEEK 2 that you can use or choose your own.
